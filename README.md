## Model

The input traffic flow tensor is decomposed into trend and seasonal parts through Trend Decomposition (De-Trend) module, and those two parts are modeled separately to extract temporal correlation. The input traffic topology graph derives a pattern matrix through Traffic Pattern Extraction (TS-Pattern) module, and that pattern matrix assists in extracting spatial correlation

## Main Results

The performance of DEC-Former was evaluated on four real-world traffic flow datasets, PeMS03, PeMS04, PeMS07 and PeMS08.
